# ROBOTY3D
A GitHub Repository for the source codes of Roboty 3D Projects.

## Submodules
Submodules update automatically every day at 00:00<br>
You can also update them manually by cloning the repo onto your local machine and running `git submodule update` to update the files on your local machine. You can then run the following commands if you have write permissions for the repo:
```
git add *
git commit -m "Update Submodules"
git push
```
<br>
Or by running the github action manually on GitHub.

If the github action fails, you can create an issue on GitHub.
